				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>I am a senior at the <a href="https://www.wm.edu/">College of William & Mary</a> pursuing a Major in Computer Science and a Minor in Data Science. Always in pursuit of continual growth and imporvment. Through my college career, I have been given the opportunity to participate in undergraduate research, take classes and learn more about material outside of my major and minor, interacted with many people having diverse backgrounds and have had some of my most cherished memories. I know I'm far from being exposed to every opinion and viewpoint, but I feel that my experiences in school, at work, and in life have shaped me into being a well-rounded listener, humbled learner, and loyal friend.</p>
				<br>
				<p>During the summer of 2020, I have been fortunate to go virtual with my internship at <a href="https://www.libertymutualgroup.com/about-lm/careers/overview">Liberty Mutual Insurance</a>. I was placed within the Corporate Functions and Analytics team, building in house tools to help provision and maintain thousands of cloud based environments for hundreds of Liberty Mutual Employees. I worked within the AWS workspace in conjunction with the environment my team created, verifying tools and tech such as Spark, Dash, Shiny, PuLP, GLPK and many others worked. Our team worked like a start-up within the larger organization, serving our co-workers and rolling out product releases, improvements and updates. To this end, I serviced and helped other employees who might have asked for help in deploying applications to their EC2 instances or EMR clusters. I also helped in the creation and deployment of Ansible Playbooks for our product, to help configure and spin up the thousands of customized instances across the organization.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Before Liberty Mutual, during the summer of 2019, I was interning at <a href="https://coalescesolutions.io/">Coalesce Solutions</a>, a Salesforce Administration and consultation start up. Coalesce gave me my first exposure to an agile style work environment, as we always had many tickets supporting multiple clients who used Salesforce to  handle their day to day internal and external interactions. During this time, I was able to help create solutions in streamlining workflow, editing and changing organizational user permissions, and improve accessibility to resources and tools on the client side. During this time, I spent time traversing through Salesforce TrailHeads, in order to understand the environment better and learn on the fly. As an intern, I was in charge of researching agile workflow software and tools that would best improve workplace efficiency for the organization. Creating trial  accounts, testing and documenting Agile tools helped me understand in a broader sense how work is conducted, how collaboration is sparked, and the best ways I could be a productive and reliable team player. </p>
				<br>
				<p>During the summer of 2018, I was fortunate and privileged enough to receive a research grant from the Wren Scholars fund at my university, the college of William & Mary. My summer blog from this year can be found <a href="http://www.cs.wm.edu/~gaespi/Journal%20Entries">here.</a> The summer research consisted of an exploratory project into the theory and science of machine learning of understanding and adopting examples. Having no previous experience with machine learning in the past, my goal was to train a bot within a grid, to find some goal within its world. I used concepts such as reinforcement learning giving the bot negative and positive rewards depending on the move it would make. Eventually, using motors, 3D printed pieces and the code, I wanted to attempt to make a bot walk, learn to walk, via iterations of failed attempts it would learn from, like a genetic algorith. My final product relied heavily on guidance and learning from examples found online, but for the purposes of learning and growing upon myself, my goal was met.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Outside of code, I am an avid hiker, wanderluster, and thrill seeker. I've picked up photography, even doing professional shoots for real estate on the market, I can can talk for hours about music, and, very originally, love food. I can go out to the world, with only camera and an idea, and not come home until dusk has settled. I feel the earth is here for all of us to explore, and ought to be trekked through. I value those spontaneous moments the most, the ones that are never planned but are always the best memories. While I do find value in planning, I am the sort of person to hear of some mountain two hours away, and go, with or without company. I feel that music is a perfect pair, the complete complementary to lived experience, thought, memory and emotion. I cannot make music for the life of me, but can listen to and talk about some of my favorite and most impactful artists for hours. No matter the situation, music of any kind may accompany and uplift it, and I love to feel that musical embrace. And for food, well this is a given! Great food is great, amazing food, spectacular, especially with the company of loved ones. Thank you for checking out my page and spending some time here!</p>
