				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>I am a senior at the <a href="https://www.wm.edu/">College of William & Mary</a> pursuing a Major in Computer Science and a Minor in Data Science. Always in pursuit of continual growth and imporvment. Through my college career, I have been given the opportunity to participate in undergraduate research, take classes and learn more about material outside of my major and minor, interacted with many people having diverse backgrounds and have had some of my most cherished memories. I know I'm far from being exposed to every opinion and viewpoint, but I feel that my experiences in school, at work, and in life have shaped me into being a well-rounded listener, humbled learner, and loyal friend.</p>
				<br><br>
				<p>During the summer of 2020, I have been fortunate to go virtual with my internship at <a href="https://www.libertymutualgroup.com/about-lm/careers/overview">Liberty Mutual Insurance</a>. I was placed within the Corporate Functions and Analytics team, building in house tools to help provision and maintain thousands of cloud based tools for hundreds of Liberty Mutual Employees. I worked within the AWS workspace in conjunction with the environment my team created, verifying tools and tech such as Spark, Dash, Shiny, PuLP, GLPK and many others worked. Our team worked like a start-up within the larger organization, serving our co-workers and rolling out product releases, improvments and updates. To this end, I serviced and helped other employees who might haved asked for help in deploying applications to their EC2 instances or EMR clusters. I also helped in the creation and deployment of Ansible Playbooks for our product, to help configure and spin up the hundreads of customized instances across the organization.</p>
